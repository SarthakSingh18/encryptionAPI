# encryptionAPI

I have created this api to encrypt and decrypt data to provide good encrypted rather than easily decryptable cipher.
I have used vault for encryption as a service and created a node wrapper around it.
Tools and technologies used:-
Nodejs,Express,docker-compose,vault by hashicorp,nginx,AWS-EC2,MongoDB,redis.

Currently I am upgrading this service to provide cipher for large data like images and videos and creating microservices using golang and moving to k8s from docker-swarm.

In Future:-
I am thinking of ways to create this as a image and developers can pull this image configure it and get good cipher in less than 90ms.
